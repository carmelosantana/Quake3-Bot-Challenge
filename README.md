# Quake 3 Bot Challenge
In a feeble attempt to intellectually engage a fellow a programmer I proposed a challenge to use AI for an upcoming project.

The original idea for the challenge was to leverage machine learning and create a proper AI, something capable of learning. However we agreed early on to loosen requirements and go with a general-purpose bot. Though not necessary, AI could be used to augment some functionality.

Anyone is welcome to participate! Please remember to make a pull request and append your results. 

## The Challenge

Make a bot capable of navigating the first deathmatch map while exercising basic offensive and defensive gameplay. 

### Requirements

* Basic navigation
* Identify enemies
* Offense
* Defense

## Rules

* You CAN use any language.
* You CAN use any means to control your bot.
    * Emulating mouse keyboard
    * Manipulating a gamepad’s i/o
    * Manipulating game memory in RAM
* You CAN write additional mods or software to extend Quake’s original functionality. *Ex: Creating a mod to simulate Lidar.*
* You CAN NOT access game memory for assistance with environmental analysis or identification of any kind.
* You CAN NOT use a previously written bot.
* You CAN NOT navigate via a predefined path.

## Timeframe

For the initial challenge we’re proposing a total time of 6 months.

## Judgement

Bots will face off on the first deathmatch map. ~~First~~ Any bot with 10 kills ~~wins!~~ is considered a success for meeting all challenge requirements! Either way **have fun!**

## Results

Make a pull request with a short description and a link to your results or project’s source if available.
